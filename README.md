## Projects Overview

This course is project-based, with each project designed to reinforce React concepts through hands-on practice.

### Project Structure

Each project includes:

- **Final**: The complete app.
- **Starter**: A starting point for you to follow along and code the app.

Each starter project contains useful assets like data, CSS, etc., to help you get started. You can work in the main directory or rename/remove "starter" as preferred.

### Setup

All projects are built with **Vite** (a fast, modern boilerplate for front-end development).

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   Start the development server:
   bash
   Copy code
   npm run dev
   Steps
   Each project includes a README.md with steps to complete the project. You can:
   ```

Try to build the entire app before watching the videos.
Follow along and build the app after each video.
Note: The steps provided are intentionally somewhat vague to encourage creative thinking and problem-solving. Feel free to interpret the steps in your way and explore different solutions!

Project Size
While Vite is efficient and minimizes size issues:

Each project is a separate entity with its own package.json and node_modules.
Projects are stored on GitHub and (optionally) deployed on Netlify, so they donâ€™t need to remain on your local machine.
CSS and Styling
Each project includes global styles (usually in index.css), with some optional CSS videos at the end of the project. Certain projects may have additional CSS content as necessary.
